README for CSCE 2610 Project
--Compiled with visual studio 2012--

Notes:

Enter one of the filenames.txt included in source dir after choosing 'run'

You are allowed to run multiple file inputs in one session but the registry
doesn't reset to all 0's...

As a result, you must re-initialize the program and enter the filename of
the next test program.

print command prints the registries

exit exits the program

It can compile using g++ on cse machines with several warning flags about my printf's
it will run fine.
